Welcome to the Mochimo Beta Test!

GETTING STARTED
You must read and agree to the LICENSE.TXT before proceeding.

Basic System Requirements:
Ubuntu 16.04 LTS 64-bit
2+ Processor Threads (if running as VM)
1+ GB of System Memory

Package Contents:
This package contains the Mochimo Betatest Software source code v20.  This code
when compiled allows you to run a node on the Mochimo TestNet, and also mines
the TestNet coins.  Included in the package is the command line wallet utility.
Please read WALLET_GUIDE, and create your own personal wallet and mining
address, before running the software.

Compiling Instructions:
The software includes a script for compiling the software, and installing the
binaries in the ./bin directory.  To compile:
cd ./src
./makeunx bin
./makeunx install

Starting the Node/Miner:
Change to the ./bin directory, and invoke the miner with the following command:
cd ../bin
./gomochi d

Stopping the Node/Miner:
Type CTRL+C and wait a moment for the monitor to appear.  Hit ? and <ENTER> to
see options.  Type q and <ENTER> to exit.  Wait a few moments for the software
to exit gracefully.

Resuming the Miner:
You may resume from where you left off (so that you don't have to resync your
blocks) by typing:
./resume d

Networking Notes:
The mochimo node is a "server" in the conventional sense, and must have direct
access to the internet.  The port that Mochimo TestNet operates on is TCP 2094.
If you are running the software behind a firewall, you will need to permit
inbound connections on TCP 2094.  If you are running the software behind a
router performing NAT, such as with a home internet connection, you will need
to configure a static private IP on your Linux box, and Port Forwarding of port
TCP 2094 to stat static private IP.
